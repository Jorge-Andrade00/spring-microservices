# Spring microservices project

This is a simple microservices project to improve my skills with Java and Spring framework.

In this project I'll try to use the best practices and a very interesting tech stack.

For this project there are three microservices: ms-product, ms-inventory and ms-order.

- ms-product: Microservice destined for products management and use a Postgres DB as storage system.
- ms-order: Microservice destined for orders management and use a MSQL DB as storage system.
- ms-inventory: Microservice destined for inventory management and use a Postgres DB as storage system.

This project use Spring Gateway to router all request and Eureka Netflix as a discovery service.
